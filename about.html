## About
Greetings ! I am a Phd candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook University, USA and am a member of the Data Science Lab. 
I am advised by Prof.Steven Skiena. My research interests lie at the intersection of Text Mining, Machine Learning and Complex Networks. 

At Data Science Lab I have worked on several projects with a focus on representation learning geared towards Natural Language Processing. I am fortunate to have collaborated on projects with Rami Al-Rfou, Bryan Perozzi at Stony Brook and Abhradeep Guha Thakurta who is currently at Apple.
