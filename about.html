## About
Greetings ! I am a Phd candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook University, USA and am a member of the Data Science Lab. 
I am advised by Prof.Steven Skiena. 
My research interests lie at the intersection of Text Mining, Machine Learning and Complex Networks. 

I obtained my Masters degree in Computer Science, also from Stony Brook University in Spring 2014. 
At Data Science Lab I have worked on several projects. 
Currently, our lab focuses on representation learning geared towards Natural Language Processing. 
We have induced word embeddings for 40 languages and demonstrated their effectiveness in several natural language processing tasks. We are currently looking at several applications involving using these embeddings for various tasks in Text Mining and Natural Language Processing.  

Prior to graduate school, I spent a few years working as a software design engineer developing software for routers and switches. Here is a copy of my resume
