The human brain and the neuronal networks comprising it are of immense interest to the scientific community.
We focus on the structural connectivity of human brains, investigating sex differences across male and female
connectomes (brain-graphs). One of our main findings discloses a statistical difference at the pars-orbitalis 
of the connectome between the sexes, which has been shown to function in language production.
