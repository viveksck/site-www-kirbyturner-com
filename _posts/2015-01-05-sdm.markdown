We build a Named Entity Recognition system (NER) for 40 languages using only language agnostic methods. 
Our system relies only on un-supervised methods for feature generation. We obtain training data for the
task of NER through a semi-supervised technique not relying whatsoever on any language specific or
orthographic features. This approach allows us to scale to large set of languages for which little human 
expertise and human annotated training data is available.  We also demonstrate competitive performance of
our method in languages like English and Spanish for which human annotated test data is available.
